        <h1>MOUNT EVEREST - THE DEADLIEST PLACE IN THE EARTH</h1>
        <div class="hero-text-section">
          <p>
            As of January 2021, 305 people have died while attempting to climb
            Mount Everest. The majority of the dead are still on the mountain.
            Some of the bodies have never been found, some serve as grim
            “markers” along the route, and some are only exposed years later
            when weather changes.

        Budapest, Hungary’s capital, is bisected by the River Danube. Its
        19th-century Chain Bridge connects the hilly Buda district with flat
        Pest. A funicular runs up Castle Hill to Buda’s Old Town, where the
        Budapest History Museum traces city life from Roman times onward.
        Trinity Square is home to 13th-century Matthias Church and the turrets
        of the Fishermen’s Bastion, which offer sweeping views

        Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti summed up Budapest beautifully when he
        once said, “If you come from Paris to Budapest you think you are in
        Moscow. If you come from Moscow to Budapest, you think you are in
        Paris.”

      <h2>Northern Lights Norway</h2>
      <p>
        Between late September and late March, Northern Norway is dark from
        early afternoon until late morning, and the northern lights frequently
        soar across the sky. ... The lights, which are also called aurora
        borealis, show up at night when the sky is dark.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our bold claim is that this part of Norway, with its multiple islands,
        deep fjords and steep mountains, is among the most beautiful and
        interesting places to see the northern lights. As hundreds of thousands
        of people live in this huge geographical area, the region of Northern
        Norway has everything from cities with a lively night scene and great
        museums to small, cosy fishing villages and vast, tranquil spaces
        without any kind of light pollution.
